  DEFY INSURANCE - ONBOARDING SYSTEM SETUP GUIDE
========================================================

This guide walks you through setting up the complete
automated onboarding system with:
  - Client form (web page)
  - Google Sheets integration (auto-save submissions)
  - Brevo email notifications (client + boss emails)

========================================================
STEP 1: GOOGLE SHEETS SETUP
========================================================

1. Go to https://sheets.google.com and create a NEW spreadsheet
2. Name it: "Defy Insurance - Client Onboarding"
3. Go to Extensions > Apps Script
4. Delete all the default code in the editor
5. Copy the ENTIRE contents of "google-apps-script.gs"
   and paste it into the Apps Script editor
6. Click the Save icon (or Ctrl+S)
7. In the function dropdown (top bar), select "initializeSheet"
8. Click "Run" - this creates the headers in your sheet
   (You'll need to authorize it the first time)
9. Click "Deploy" > "New deployment"
10. Click the gear icon > Select "Web app"
11. Settings:
    - Description: "Defy Onboarding Form Backend"
    - Execute as: "Me"
    - Who has access: "Anyone"
12. Click "Deploy"
13. COPY the Web App URL (looks like: https://script.google.com/macros/s/XXXXX/exec)
14. Open "script.js" and replace:
    YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL_HERE
    with the URL you copied

========================================================
STEP 2: BREVO (EMAIL) SETUP
========================================================

Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) sends automatic emails
to clients and your boss when forms are submitted.

1. Go to https://www.brevo.com and create a free account
   (Free plan: 300 emails/day - more than enough)
2. After signing up, go to your dashboard
3. Navigate to: Settings (gear icon) > SMTP & API > API Keys
4. Click "Generate a new API key"
5. Name it: "Defy Onboarding System"
6. COPY the API key
7. Open "script.js" and replace:
    YOUR_BREVO_API_KEY_HERE
    with your Brevo API key

8. VERIFY YOUR SENDER EMAIL:
   - Go to Settings > Senders, Domains & Dedicated IPs > Senders
   - Click "Add a sender"
   - Add the email you want to send FROM
     (e.g., onboarding@defyinsurance.com or your gmail)
   - Verify it by clicking the link in the confirmation email

9. UPDATE THESE VALUES in script.js:
   - BOSS_EMAIL: Your boss's actual email address
   - BOSS_NAME: Your boss's name
   - SENDER_EMAIL: The verified sender email from step 8
   - SENDER_NAME: "Defy Insurance - Affinity Program" (or customize)

========================================================
STEP 3: HOSTING THE FORM (OPTIONS)
========================================================

The form needs to be hosted somewhere so clients can
access it via a link. Here are your options:

--- OPTION A: Netlify (FREE - Easiest) ---
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Sign up (free)
3. Drag and drop the ENTIRE folder containing:
   - index.html
   - styles.css
   - script.js
   into the Netlify deploy area
4. You'll get a URL like: https://your-site.netlify.app
5. You can set a custom domain if you want

--- OPTION B: GitHub Pages (FREE) ---
1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push index.html, styles.css, script.js to the repo
3. Go to Settings > Pages
4. Set source to "main" branch
5. Your form will be at: https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name

--- OPTION C: Local / Send Files Directly ---
1. You can just open index.html in a browser to test
2. For sharing, you'd need one of the hosting options above

--- OPTION D: Vercel (FREE) ---
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Import your folder/repo
3. Deploy with one click

========================================================
STEP 4: TESTING THE SYSTEM
========================================================

1. Open index.html in your browser (or your hosted URL)
2. Fill out the form with test data
3. Submit the form
4. Check:
   [ ] Google Sheet has a new row with all the data
   [ ] Client email received (check the email you entered)
   [ ] Boss email received (check the boss email)
5. If Google Sheets works but emails don't:
   - Double-check Brevo API key
   - Make sure sender email is verified in Brevo
   - Check browser console (F12) for error messages
6. If nothing works:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Make sure the Google Apps Script URL is correct
   - Re-deploy the Apps Script if needed

========================================================
STEP 5: SHARING WITH CLIENTS
========================================================

Once everything is working:
1. Send clients the form URL
2. Suggested email to clients:

   Subject: Defy Insurance - Complete Your Onboarding Form

   Hi [Client Name],

   Welcome to the Defy Insurance Affinity Advantage Program!

   To get started, please complete our onboarding form:
   [YOUR FORM URL]

   The form takes about 10-15 minutes to complete. Please have
   your LinkedIn login credentials ready.

   After you submit, your Project Manager will reach out within
   24 hours to schedule your onboarding meeting.

   Best regards,
   [Your Name]
   Defy Insurance

FILE OVERVIEW
========================================================

index.html          - The onboarding form (main page)
styles.css          - Styling and design
script.js           - Form logic + Google Sheets + Brevo emails
google-apps-script.gs - Code to paste into Google Apps Script
SETUP_GUIDE.txt     - This file

========================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================================

Q: Form submits but nothing shows in Google Sheets?
A: Make sure you deployed the Apps Script as a "Web app"
   with "Anyone" access, and pasted the correct URL.

Q: Emails not sending?
A: Check that your Brevo API key is correct and your
   sender email is verified in Brevo settings.

Q: Form shows "CORS error" in console?
A: The Google Apps Script request uses 'no-cors' mode,
   so this is normal. Data should still be saved.

Q: Need to update the Apps Script?
A: After making changes, you must create a NEW deployment
   (Deploy > New deployment) and update the URL in script.js.

Q: Can I customize the form fields?
A: Yes! Edit index.html to add/remove fields. Then update
   the HEADERS array in google-apps-script.gs to match,
   and update the row-building logic in doPost().
